As a user
I want to be able to search
So that I can find interesting content

Scenario 1 - Logged in search
Given
    I am logged in with username "test_account" and password "test"
    And I go to "/search.html"
When
    I see "search field" textbox
    And I fill "search field" textbox with "pyccuracy rocks"
    And I click "search" button and wait
Then
   I see "Search for pyccuracy rocks - My cool website" title
